# awt_musicplatform
This project is a simple music platform focused on implementing user registration and login functionality. The main goal was to create a secure and functional authentication system from scratch using core web technologies.

Key Features:
User signup and login system
Frontend built with HTML and CSS
JavaScript used for client-side form validation
PHP backend to handle data processing
MySQL database to store and retrieve user information

How It Works:
Users can create an account by filling out a registration form
JavaScript checks for valid input before submission
Form data is sent to the PHP backend
PHP communicates with a MySQL database to store new users or authenticate existing ones
When a user logs in, their credentials are checked against the database using a PHP file to verify authenticity

This platform serves as a foundational project in full-stack web development, demonstrating integration between frontend, backend, and database layers.
